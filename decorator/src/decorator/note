First of all we have the Beverage class, that is a interface that all components
have to implement. 

Then we have the decorators. Each decorator has to implement Beverage too, but they 
also have to have a instance of some class that implements Beverage class.

Then all concrete decorators, in this case Coffee and Cinnamon, have to extend 
from the Decorator class.
